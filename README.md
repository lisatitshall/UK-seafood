# UK Seafood Report

## Summary 
Use Power BI to explore UK seafood data retrieved from [UK Data Service](https://reshare.ukdataservice.ac.uk/856955/). The data includes information about what's being produced, imported, exported and consumed. 

### Data Notes
- Fisheries means fishing from the natural environment and aquaculture is harvesting/farming fish.
- Consumer demand is higher for the "big five": cod, haddock, tuna, salmon and prawns. 

### Things to Investigate
- Does the data mention where products are being imported from?
- Is there any data on fish stocks / sustainable fishing?
- How much of our consumption is of the big five fish? Has this changed over time?
- How much of the big five are we importing? What other fish are we exporting and in what quantities?
- Is there any data on carbon emissions of producing and trading fish?
- Would it be possible to compare this data with another country?
